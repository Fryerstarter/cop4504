# cop4504
Project 1 for COP4504 - UNF Fall 2017



HOW TO RUN
-you need to replace hardcoded IP in Client.java, I found mine by googling "what is my ip". I also had to open port 9090 (hardcoded 
in Server.java)
-make sure you have javac enabled in command prompt. You can do this by adding the JDK\bin folder to your system PATH
-navigate command prompt to source code folder
-to compile:
  javac Server.java
  javac Client.java

-open 2 cmd prompts and navigate to folder with .class files
  java Server
  java Client
